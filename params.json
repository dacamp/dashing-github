Uses [GitHubs Status API](https://status.github.com/)\r\n\r\n##Dependencies\r\n\r\n[httparty](http://rubygems.org/gems/httparty)\r\n\r\nAdd it to dashing's gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'httparty'\r\n    \r\nand run `bundle install`. Everything should work now :)\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\n\r\nTo use this widget, copy `github_status.html`, `github_status.coffee`, and `github_status.scss` into the `/widgets/github_status` directory. Put the `github_status.rb` file in your `/jobs` folder.\r\n\r\nYou'll also need various images from GitHub [InvertoCat](https://status.github.com/images/invertocat.png), [Good Logo](https://status.github.com/images/logo-good.png), [Minor Logo](https://status.github.com/images/logo-minor.png), and [Major Logo](https://status.github.com/images/logo-major.png).  *Download* them. Please do not leech them from Github for each request you make to your widgit! Download them, and put the files in your `/assets/images` folder.\r\n\r\nTo download images, run the following script from your ROOT directory: `./tmp/github_pngs.sh`\r\n\r\nTo include the widget in a dashboard, add the following snippet to the dashboard layout file:\r\n\r\n    <li data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"1\" data-sizex=\"1\" data-sizey=\"1\">\r\n      <div data-id=\"github_status\" data-view=\"GithubStatus\" data-title=\"GitHub Status\"></div>\r\n    </li>\r\n\r\n##Settings\r\n\r\nStatus is fetched every minute, which maybe a bit much. You can change that by editing the job schedule.",
